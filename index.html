            <p>I'm a student web developer currently enrolled in KU's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>I love to paint, draw, and create digital art in my spare time, and I work as an IT Support Specialist for a local credit union.
                I'm based in Bonner Springs, KS but was born and raised in Wichita, KS. I moved to the KC Metro in April 2019 to be closer to family.
                Since moving here, I have made great friends, got a good job with a company that I love, and picked up new hobbies.
                I have two cats, Beans and Frankie, who are the light of my life.
            <p>My natural eye for design and ability to quickly learn new technologies led to my decision to enroll in classes for web development.
                 So far, I am getting the hang of things pretty quickly and I can't wait to learn more and create some cool pages and programs.
                 HTML, CSS and Bootstrap have been fun to learn about, but I am really looking forward to digging into Javascript.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>The portfolio page of this site will be filled out with projects as I complete them. I aim to gain enough skill to become a career-competetive full-stack developer by mid-2021.
            </p>
            <p>Check back on my website periodically to see what I've created in class! Thanks for visiting!</p>
